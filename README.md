# Rancher Dashboard
Rancher Dashboard is the UI that powers [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/products/rancher).

Rancher Dashboard supports an extension mechanism that allows developers to independently provide additional functionality to Rancher. You can learn more from our [Rancher Extensions Docs](https://extensions.rancher.io).

# What is it?
