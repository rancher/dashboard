  typeDescriptions:
    apps.daemonset: DaemonSets run exactly one pod on every eligible node. When new nodes are added to the cluster, DaemonSets automatically deploy to them. Recommended for system-wide or vertically-scalable workloads that never need more than one pod per node.
    apps.deployment: Deployments run a scalable number of replicas of a pod distributed among the eligible nodes. Changes are rolled out incrementally and can be rolled back to the previous revision when needed. Recommended for stateless & horizontally-scalable workloads.
    apps.statefulset: StatefulSets manage stateful applications and provide guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of the pods created. Recommended for workloads with persistent storage or strict identity, quorum, or upgrade order requirements.
    batch.cronjob: CronJobs create Jobs, which then run Pods, on a repeating schedule. The schedule is expressed in standard Unix cron format, and uses the timezone of the Kubernetes control plane (typically UTC).
    batch.job: Jobs create one or more pods to reliably perform a one-time task by running a pod until it exits successfully. Failed pods are automatically replaced until the specified number of completed runs has been reached. Jobs can also run multiple pods in parallel or function as a batch work queue.
  upgrading:
    activeDeadlineSeconds:
      label: Pod Active Deadline
      tip: The duration the pod may be active before the system will try to mark it failed and kill associated containers.
    concurrencyPolicy:
      label: Concurrency
      options:
        allow: Allow CronJobs to run concurrently
        forbid: Skip next run if current run hasn't finished
        replace: Replace run if current run hasn't finished
    maxSurge:
      label: Max Surge
      tip: The maximum number of pods allowed beyond the desired scale at any given time.
    maxUnavailable:
      label: Max Unavailable
      tip: The maximum number of pods which can be unavailable at any given time.
    minReadySeconds:
      label: Minimum Ready
      tip: The minimum duration a pod should be ready without containers crashing for it to be considered available.
    podManagementPolicy:
      label: Pod Management Policy
    progressDeadlineSeconds:
      label: Progress Deadline
      tip: The minimum duration to wait for a deployment to progress before marking it failed.
    revisionHistoryLimit:
      label: Revision History Limit
      tip: The number of old ReplicaSets to retain for rollback.
    strategies:
      labels:
        delete: "On Delete: New pods are only created when old pods are manually deleted."
        recreate: "Recreate: Kill ALL pods, then start new pods."
        rollingUpdate: "Rolling Update: Create new pods, until max surge is reached, before deleting old pods. Don't stop more pods than max unavailable."
    terminationGracePeriodSeconds:
      label: Termination Grace Period
      tip: The duration the pod needs to terminate successfully.
