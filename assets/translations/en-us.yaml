    descriptions:
      apps.daemonset: <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >DaemonSets</a> run exactly one pod on every eligible node. When new nodes are added to the cluster, DaemonSets automatically deploy to them. Recommended for system-wide or vertically-scalable workloads that never need more than one pod per node.
      apps.deployment: '<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >Deployments</a> run a scalable number of replicas of a pod distributed among the eligible nodes. Changes are rolled out incrementally and can be rolled back to the previous revision when needed. Recommended for stateless & horizontally-scalable workloads.'
      apps.statefulset: <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >StatefulSets</a> manage stateful applications and provide guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of the pods created. Recommended for workloads with persistent storage or strict identity, quorum, or upgrade order requirements.
      batch.cronjob: <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >CronJobs</a> create Jobs, which then run Pods, on a repeating schedule. The schedule is expressed in standard Unix <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> format, and uses the timezone of the Kubernetes control plane (typically UTC).
      batch.job: <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >Jobs</a> create one or more pods to reliably perform a one-time task by running a pod until it exits successfully. Failed pods are automatically replaced until the specified number of completed runs has been reached. Jobs can also run multiple pods in parallel or function as a batch work queue.
    titles:
      advanced: 
        title: Advanced
        subtitle: Define the advanced options. Each pod has additional options that can be defined as part of the container, part of the pod and part of the workload type. We recommends reading the detailed Kubernetes documentation before attempting to configure these.
      defineContainer: 
        title: Define Container
        subtitle: Define the container of the pod. Each workload type ultimately deploys pods, which are the smallest unit of compute managed by Kubernetes. The main definition of the pod is the container. These are the basic fields defined on a container, but there are more fields that can be defined in the Advanced step or in the raw yaml.
      scaling: Scaling/Upgrade Policy
      selectType: 
        title: Select a Workload Type
        subtitle: Select the type of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">workload</a> to create. Each type has unique properties that define where the pods will be run, how they will be maintained or scaled, and what happens when they fail.
      storage: 
        title: Storage
        subtitle: Pods only have their own local ephemeral storage by default, which will be wiped out when the pod dies. To persist data that survives beyond the life of a single pod, you can attach external <a href='https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/' target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">storage</a> (e.g. block devices or NFS shares) from a provider and make it available to the pod.
