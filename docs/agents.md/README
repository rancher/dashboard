# Agents.md

This folder contains files used to construct a single root `AGENTS.md`

We do this because
- The single commonality between almost all AI tools is the root AGENTS.md
- Referencing other files within an AGENTS.md may be ignored

Process
1. Add files to or update files in `./docs/agents.md/agents`, `./docs/agents.md/personas`, `./docs/agents.md/contributors`.
2. Each file must
  - Start markdown headers at the `##` level
  - End in a new line
  - Order contents in AGENTS.md by giving an optional number prefix
3. Run `yarn agents:generate`.
   - Take the contents of `./docs/agents.md/template_agents.md`
   - Insert the contents of the agents, personas and contributors files
   - Output to `./AGENTS.md`
4. Commit all changes, including root `./AGENTS.md`


Future Tasks
- Add real world examples of code examples
- Create a GH workflow to monitor `agents.md` folder files in a PR, if changed run generate script and add new AGENTS.md to PR
- Determine how AI tool specific metadata code can be included
- Determine how AI specific patterns, like co-pilot instructions, can be expressed in a way to be adopted by or reduce duplication with the root agents.md
- Discuss the multiple agents vs personas approach works
