# Getting Started

This guide is intended for developers new to Rancher and the Dashboard. It will be expanded over time and we welcome contributions.

First take some time to understand the [README](../../../README.md). This covers a lot of useful information that this document references and supplements. It's helpful reviewing the `README` once again after experience is gained and concepts are more familiar.
