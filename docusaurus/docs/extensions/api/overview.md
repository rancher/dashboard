# Extensions API

## Introduction

Rancher provides the Extensions API which provides several methods on the `plugin` object to enhance the Rancher Dashboard UI in key areas of the interface.

They should be defined where the extension is initialized.

You can find an installable extension providing some usage examples of the Extensions API here: https://github.com/rancher/ui-plugin-examples.

These are the currently available methods of the Extension API.
