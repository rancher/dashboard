# Extensions API

Rancher provides a set of Extension hooks to developers.

We recommend starting from the [Product Registration](./products.md) chapter in order to learn the basics on how to register your new extension and how you can customise it.

You can find installable extensions providing some usage examples of the Extensions API here: https://github.com/rancher/ui-plugin-examples.

For information regarding the support of each Extension API hook available, check it's support matrix [here](../support-matrix#extension-api-support-matrix).
