## <a name="add-your-extension"></a>Add your extension to this page

Fork this repository and create a new yaml file in the `docusaurus/docs/extensions/catalog`, name it with the name of your extension and a file extension of `.yaml`.

The content for this file should be based off of this template:

```
name: <Name of your extension>
author: <Name to show as the author of the extension>
authorUrl: <URL to open in a new tab when the user clicks on the author name>
description: <Short description of the extension - please limit to around 120 characters>
url: <URL to open in a new tab when the user clicks on the 'Learn More...' link>
icon: <URL for the icon to show for your extension - this should be sized 48x48 pixels>
```

Open a PR that adds your yaml file. The team will review your PR and once approved and merged, your extension will appear here.
