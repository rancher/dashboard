# Getting Started

This guide will walk through setting up your development environment and creating a new Rancher extension.

For an easy follow of this guide, there is two different concepts that a developer should understand:
- A `Development app` is the environment on which you will develop and test your Rancher extensions. In a `Development app` you can have multiple `extensions`/`packages`
- An `extension`/`package` is the actual extension code

## Prerequisites

> Note: Extensions development is only currently supported on Mac and Linux. Windows is not currently supported.

- **Node.js Version:**
  - For **legacy-v1** or **legacy-v2**, you will need Node.js **version `v16`** (tested with `v16.19.1`).
  - For the latest version, you will need Node.js **version `v20`** (tested with `v20.17.0`).
- Yarn package manager installed globally: `npm install -g yarn`.
- Have a Rancher system up and running. See https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade

---

## Generating the Development app and your first extension

To develop a new extension, you need an application UI to host it during development. Rancher provides a helper to create a development app for you. This gives you a full version of the Rancher UI that can be used to develop and test your extension.

Rancher publishes a single npm package, `@rancher/extension`, to help bootstrap the creation of the development app and your first extension. This replaces the previous separate creators (`@rancher/app` and `@rancher/pkg`). These can target different Rancher systems.

When creating extensions, it is important to match the version of the `@rancher/extension` package with the target Rancher version:

- **For Rancher `v2.7` and `v2.8`:** Use the `legacy-v1` tag.
- **For Rancher `v2.9`:** Use the `legacy-v2` tag.
- **For Rancher `v2.10` or later:** Use the `latest` version of `@rancher/extension`.

> Note: The development app references the Rancher dashboard code via the `@rancher/shell` npm module. Each version is bound to different Rancher versions. You can check the `shell` support matrix **[here](./support-matrix.md)**.

### Usage for `latest` tag

To create a `development app` with an extension targeting Rancher `v2.10` or later, run:

```sh
npm init @rancher/extension my-app
cd my-app && yarn install
```

This command will create a new development app in a folder called `my-app` and also create you first extension package also named `my-app` (inside `/pkg` folder) populating it with the minimum files needed for your extension.

If you want want to add another `extension` inside the same development app, you'll need to be inside the root folder of the development app and just run the init command with the desired name for the other extension:

```sh
npm init @rancher/extension another-extension
```

> NOTE: the `npm init` command must always use the same tag as the one that generated it. Also check examples below.

### Usage for `legacy` versions

> Note: The documentation for these legacy versions 

**For Rancher `v2.7` and `v2.8`**

To target these versions, use the `legacy-v1` tag:

```sh
npm init @rancher/extension@legacy-v1 my-app
cd my-app && yarn install
```

If you want want to add another `extension` inside the same development app, you'll need to be inside the root folder of the development app and just run the init command with the desired name for the other extension:

```sh
npm init @rancher/extension@legacy-v1 another-extension
```

**For Rancher `v2.9`:**

To target this version, use the `legacy-v2` tag:

```sh
npm init @rancher/extension@legacy-v2 my-app
cd my-app && yarn install
```

If you want want to add another `extension` inside the same development app, you'll need to be inside the root folder of the development app and just run the init command with the desired name for the other extension:

```sh
npm init @rancher/extension@legacy-v2 another-extension
```

In both legacy cases, ensure you are using Node.js version `v16` during development and testing.

### _Extension Options_

There are a few options available to be passed as an argument to the `@rancher/extension` script:

|          Option           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :-----------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     `--update \| -u`      | This will update all dependencies within the extension to match the declared version of the `@rancher/shell` library based on the tag. See the [Updating Guide](./updating-extensions.md) for usage.                                                                                               |
| `--app-name \| -a <name>` | Allows specifying a different name for the development app instead of using the extension name.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  `--skeleton-only \| -s`  | Installs only the development app without creating the extension package.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|           `-l`            | This will automatically add the [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/blob/master/creators/extension/app/files/.gitlab-ci.yml) pipeline file for integration with GitLab                                                                                              |
|           `-w`            | Does not add the Github workflow files [`build-extension-catalog.yml`, `build-extension-charts.yml`](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/tree/master/creators/extension/app/files/.github/workflows) to be used as Github actions. These files will be added automatically by default. |
|           `-t`            | Does not add the template folders automatically into the Extension package. These folders will be added automatically by default                                                                                                                                                        |


- If you want the development app to have a different name than the extension package, you can use the `--app-name` (or `-a`) option:

```sh
npm init @rancher/extension new-extension --app-name my-app
```

This will create a development app named `my-app` and an extension package named `new-extension`.

- If you are already within a development app and want to create another extension package within the same application, simply run the same command:

```sh
npm init @rancher/extension another-extension
```

In this case, only a new extension package (`another-extension`) will be created under the existing development app. No additional development app will be generated.

- If you only want to create the development app without any extension package, you can use the `--skeleton-only` (or `-s`) option:

```sh
npm init @rancher/extension my-app --skeleton-only
```

This will create only the development app, and you can later add extension packages as needed.

This flexibility allows you to structure your development environment based on your specific needs, whether you're starting fresh or adding to an existing setup.

### Compatibility Note

As stated before, when you generate/support multiple extensions fom the same development app please make sure that all packages and the development app share the same tag. The Node.js version required depends on the tag, as outlined in the prerequisites section. Matching tags and Node.js versions is critical to avoid compatibility issues.


## Running the Development app

After you've generated your development app and You can run the app with:

```sh
yarn install
API=<Rancher Backend URL> yarn dev
```

You should be able to open a browser at https://127.0.0.1:8005 and you'll get the Rancher Dashboard UI. Your development app is a full Rancher UI - but referenced via `npm`.

## Developing your first Extension

To develop your first extension, you can check the documentation for the **[Extensions API](./api/overview.md)** to learn all the resources that an extension can use, or you can just follow the **[Usecases/Examples](./usecases/overview.md)** that we have included in our documentation for the most common usecases. Nevertheless, we will include a very quick guide below for you to follow.

### Basic extension example

Replace the contents of the file `./pkg/my-app/index.ts` with:

```ts
import { importTypes } from '@rancher/auto-import';
import { IPlugin } from '@shell/core/types';
import extensionRouting from './routing/extension-routing';

// Init the package
export default function (plugin: IPlugin) {
  // Auto-import model, detail, edit from the folders
  importTypes(plugin);

  // Provide extension metadata from package.json
  // it will grab information such as `name` and `description`
  plugin.metadata = require('./package.json');

  // Load a product
  plugin.addProduct(require('./product'));

  // Add Vue Routes
  plugin.addRoutes(extensionRouting);
}
```

Next, create a new file `./pkg/my-app/product.ts` with this content:

```ts
import { IPlugin } from '@shell/core/types';

export function init($plugin: IPlugin, store: any) {
  const YOUR_PRODUCT_NAME = 'myProductName';
  const BLANK_CLUSTER = '_';

  const { product } = $plugin.DSL(store, YOUR_PRODUCT_NAME);

  product({
    icon: 'gear',
    inStore: 'management',
    weight: 100,
    to: {
      name: `${YOUR_PRODUCT_NAME}-c-cluster`,
      path: `/${YOUR_PRODUCT_NAME}/c/:cluster/dashboard`,
      params: {
        product: YOUR_PRODUCT_NAME,
        cluster: BLANK_CLUSTER,
        pkg: YOUR_PRODUCT_NAME,
      },
    },
  });
}
```

And finally create a file + folder `/routing/extension-routing.js` with the content:

```js
// Don't forget to create a VueJS page called index.vue in the /pages folder!!!
import Dashboard from '../pages/index.vue';

const BLANK_CLUSTER = '_';
const YOUR_PRODUCT_NAME = 'myProductName';

const routes = [
  {
    name: `${YOUR_PRODUCT_NAME}-c-cluster`,
    path: `/${YOUR_PRODUCT_NAME}/c/:cluster`,
    component: Dashboard,
    meta: {
      product: YOUR_PRODUCT_NAME,
      cluster: BLANK_CLUSTER,
      pkg: YOUR_PRODUCT_NAME,
    },
  },
];

export default routes;
```

This will create an entry on the main navigation bar in Rancher UI and when clicked it will take you to a `dashboard` page inside it


## Building the Extension

Up until now, we've run the extension inside of the development app. To build the extension so we can use it independently, run:

```sh
yarn build-pkg my-app
```

This will build the extension as a Vue library and the built extension will be placed in the `dist-pkg` folder.

## Loading Into Rancher in a quick way (Developer Load)

### Test built extension by doing a Developer load

To enable Developer load in the UI, you should go to the user avatar in the top-right and go to `Preferences`. Under `Advanced Features`, check the `Enable Extension developer features` checkbox.

![Preferences](./screenshots/preferences.png)

![Extension Developer Features](./screenshots/extension-developer-features.png)

Now we need to serve the built package locally by running the following:

```sh
yarn serve-pkgs
```

This will start a small web server (on port 4500) that serves up the contents of the `dist-pkg` folder. It will output which extensions are being served up - in our case you should see output like that below - it shows the URLs to use for each of the available extensions.

```console
Serving catalog on http://127.0.0.1:4500

Serving packages:

  my-app-0.1.0 available at: http://127.0.0.1:4500/my-app-0.1.0/my-app-0.1.0.umd.min.js
```

Now jump back into the UI and bring in the slide-in menu (click on the hamburger menu in the top-left) and click on 'Extensions'.

![Developer Load](./screenshots/dev-load.png)

Go to the three dot menu and select 'Developer load' - you'll get a dialog allowing you to load the extension into the UI.

![Developer Load Modal](./screenshots/dev-load-modal.png)

In the top input box `Extension URL`, enter:

```
https://127.0.0.1:8005/pkg/my-app-0.1.0/my-app-0.1.0.umd.min.js
```

Press 'Load' and the extension will be loaded, you should see a notification telling you the extension was loaded and if you bring in the side menu again, you should see the Example nav item there now.

This illustrates dynamically loading an extension.

You'll notice that if you reload the Rancher UI, the extension is not persistent and will need to be added again. You can make it persistent by checking the `Persist extension by creating custom resource` checkbox in the Developer Load dialog.

### Prevent loading your extension in dev mode

When we run `API=<Rancher Backend URL> yarn dev`, our test extension will be automatically loaded into the application - this allows us to develop
the extension with hot-reloading. To test loading the extension dynamically, we can update configuration to tell Rancher not to include our extension.

To do this, edit the file `vue.config.js` in the root `my-app` folder, and add the name of the package you want to exclude, such as:

```js
const config = require('@rancher/shell/vue.config');

module.exports = config(__dirname, {
  excludes: ['my-app'],
});
```

Now restart your app by running the UI again with:

```sh
API=<Rancher Backend URL> yarn dev
```

Open a web browser to https://127.0.0.1:8005 and you'll see that the Example nav item is not present - since the extension was not loaded.

> Note: You need to be an admin user to test Extensions in the Rancher UI

## Releasing your extension as a Helm Chart

Creating a Release for your extension is the official avenue for loading extensions into any Rancher instance. As mentioned in the [introduction](./introduction.md), the extension can be packaged into a Helm chart and added as a Helm repository to be easily accessible from your Rancher Manager or it can even be published as an an Extension Catalog Image (container registry). You should check all the information related to Releasing/Publishing an extension [here](./publishing.md).

For the Getting Started guide, we will only focus on releasing your extension as a [Helm Chart](./publishing#publishing-an-extension-as-a-helm-chart). For that we recommend following the **[baked-in automated publish on Github](./publishing.md#helm-chart-automated-approach)** that we offer via Github workflows.

> Note: GitLab support is offered through leverging the ECI build. For configuration instructions, follow the setps in the [Gitlab Integration](./publishing#gitlab-integration) section.


### Release Prerequisites

Check all the release prerequisites information [here](./publishing#release-prerequisites).

### Consuming the Helm chart

Check all the information on how to consume the generated Helm Chart on Rancher [here](./publishing#consuming-the-helm-chart).

## Wrap-up

This guide has showed you how to create a development app that helps you develop and test one or more extensions.

We showed how we can develop and test those with hot-reloading in the browser and how we can build our extensions into a package that we can dynamically load into Rancher at runtime. We also went over how to release our extensions as Helm charts using the automated workflow.
