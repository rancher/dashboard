# Rancher Extensions

Rancher Extensions provides a mechanism to add new functionality to the Dashboard UI at runtime.

Extensions can be created independently of Rancher and their code can live in separate GitHub repositories. They are compiled as Vue libraries and packaged up with a simple Helm chart to allow easy installation into Rancher.

You can find some example extensions here: https://github.com/rancher/ui-plugin-examples

**With the upcoming release of Rancher v2.10, we have introduced a new version of the Rancher Extensions documentation (v3), along with a migration guide to help get your extension compliant with Rancher v2.10 since we've moved from Vue2 to Vue3. Learn more about it [here](./rancher-2.10-support.md).**
