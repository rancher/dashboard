# Rancher 2.10.0 update

## What will be happening in the coming months

Our team is actively working towards migrating Rancher UI to `Vue3` in order to be up to date with the industry standards.  
This will have an impact on Rancher Extensions that, for now, we are evaluating and monitoring very closely. We hope to share some news with all developers as soon as we have compiled all the information. Stay tuned!
