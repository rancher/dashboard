# Developer Documentation

Welcome to the Rancher Dashboard Developer Documentation.

Rancher Dashboard is the extensible UI that ships a part of the Open-Source [Rancher platform](https://www.rancher.com).

This documentation is intended to help developers contribute to the Dashboard UI either directly or through Rancher Extensions.

## How this Documentation is Organised

The [Getting Started](getting-started/concepts) section documents general concepts, the development environment and provides a walk-through of the Rancher Dashboard UI.

Extension developers should head over to the [Extensions](extensions/introduction) section and start their journey there.
