# Stores

## Location
The definitions of stores reside in `shell/store`. Stores added to `shell/nuxt/store.js` will be initialized at the start of the app rendering. 


## Notes
This file was generated by nuxt and will soon be redefined by hand. It's safe to add new stores to this file.

## Pattern 
Define the store in a file that resides within `shell/store`. Then add the store to `shell/nuxt/store.js`.

shell/nuxt/store.js
```js
...
resolveStoreModules(require('../store/i18n.js'), 'i18n.js')
...
```
