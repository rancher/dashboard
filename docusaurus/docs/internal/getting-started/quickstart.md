# Quickstart

## Running for Development

To get started running the UI for development:

Prerequisites:

* Node 16 (later versions are currently not supported)

* yarn:
  ```npm install --global yarn```

Run:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# For development, serve with hot reload at https://localhost:8005
# using the endpoint for your Rancher API
API=https://your-rancher yarn dev
# or put the variable into a .env file
# Goto https://localhost:8005
```

> Note: `API` is the URL of a deployed Rancher environment (backend API)

## Troubleshooting 

If `yarn dev` fails with the following error:

```
Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
    at new Hash (node:internal/crypto/hash:71:19)
    at Object.createHash (node:crypto:130:10)

...

    at FSReqCallback.readFileAfterClose [as oncomplete] (node:internal/fs/read_file_context:68:3) {
  opensslErrorStack: [ 'error:03000086:digital envelope routines::initialization error' ],
  library: 'digital envelope routines',
  reason: 'unsupported',
  code: 'ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED'
}
```

You can force Node to use the legacy openssl provider via:

```
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

The need for this option will be removed as soon as later Node versions get supported.
