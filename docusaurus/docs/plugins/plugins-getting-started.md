# Getting Started

This guide will walk through creating a new extension from scratch.

## Prerequisites

You will need a recent version of nodejs installed.

You'll also need the yarn package manage installed, which can be done with `npm install -g yarn`.

## Creating a Skeleton Application

In order to develop a new Extension, you need an application UI to host it in during development.

Rancher provides a helper to create a skeleton application for you.

`cd` to a folder not within the checkout and run:

```
yarn create @rancher/app my-app
cd my-app
```

This will create a new folder `my-app` and populate it with the minimum files needed.

> Note: If you don't want to create a new folder, but instead when the files created in an existing folder, use `yarn create @rancher/app .`

> Note: The skeleton application references the Rancher dashboard code via the `@rancher/shell` npm module.

You can run the app with:

```
yarn install
API=<Rancher Backend URL> yarn dev
```

> Note: You will need to have a Rancher backend available and the `API` environment variable above set correctly to reference it.

You should be able to open a browser at https://127.0.0.1:8005 and you'll get the Rancher Dashboard UI.

You're skeleton application is a full Rancher UI - but referenced via `npm`.

The next step is to create an extension.

Once again, Rancher provides a helper to add an extension. You can choose to have multiple extensions or a single extension within
the parent folder.

Go ahead and run the following command to create a new extension:

```
yarn create @rancher/pkg test
```

This will create a new UI Package in the `pkg/test` folder.

Replace the contents of the file `pkg/test/index.js` with:

```
import { importTypes } from '@rancher/auto-import';

// Init the package
export default function($plugin) {
  // Auto-import model, detail, edit from the folders
  importTypes($plugin);

  $plugin.addProduct(require('./product'));
}

```

Next, create a new file `pkg/test/product.js` with this content:

```
export function init($plugin, store) {
  const { product } = $plugin.DSL(store, $plugin.name);

  product({
    icon:                  'gear',
    inStore:               'management',
    removable:             false,
    showClusterSwitcher:   false,
  });
}
```

We've created a bare bones extension and exposed a new 'product' that will appear in the top-level slide-in menu. At this stage, it does
nothing other than that!

You should now be able to run the UI again with:

```
yarn dev
```

Open a web browser to https://127.0.0.1:8005 and you'll see a new 'Example' nav item in the top-level slide-in menu.

Note, that you should be able to make changes to the extension and the UI will hot-reload and update in the browser.

## Building the Extension

Up until now, we've run the extension inside of the skeleton application - this is the developer workload.

To build the extension so we can use it independently, run:

```
yarn build-pkg test
```

This will build the extension as a Vue library and the built extension will be placed in the `dist-pkg` folder.

## Loading the Extension

When we run `yarn dev` at the moment, our test extension will be automatically loaded in the application - this allows us to develop
the extension with hot-reload.

To test loading the extension dynamically, we can update configuration to tell Rancher not to include our extension.

To do this, create a new `.env` file in the root `test-app` folder, and add these contents:

```
EXCLUDES_PKG='test'
```

If necessary, bring in the environment variables by running `source .env`.

Now, run the UI with:

```
yarn dev
```

Open a web browser to https://127.0.0.1:8005 and you'll see that the Example nav item is not present - since the extension was not loaded.

> Note: You need to be an admin user to test Extensions in the Rancher UI

Go to the user avatar in the top-right and go to 'Preferences'. Under 'Advanced Features', check the `Enable Extension developer features' checkbox.

Now, bring in the slide-in menu (click on the hamburger menu in the top-left) and click on 'Extensions'.

Go to the three dot menu and select 'Developer load' - you'll get a dialog allowing you to load the extension into the UI.

In the top input box `Extension URL`, enter:

```
https://127.0.0.1:8005/pkg/test-0.1.0/test-0.1.0.umd.min.js
```

Press 'Load' and the extension will be loaded and you should see a notification telling you the extension was loaded and if you bring in the side menu again, you should see the Example nav item there now.

This illustrates dynamically loading an extension.

> Note that when we started the UI, it serves up any extensions in the `dist-pkg` folder under the `/pkg` route of the app. Also note that when we build extensions they are versioned, so you'll see that reflected in the URL we used.

## Loading the Extension into another Rancher

In the steps above, we were able to load the extension into our test application.

We can load the extension into any running Rancher.

Run the following:

```
yarn serve-pkgs
```

This will start a small web server (on port 4500) that serves up the contents of the `dist-pkg` folder. It will output which extensions are being served up - in our case you should see output like that below - it shows the URLs to use for each of the available extensions.

```
Serving catalog on http://127.0.0.1:4500

Serving packages:

  test-0.1.0 available at: http://127.0.0.1:4500/test-0.1.0/test-0.1.0.umd.min.js
```

In a different Rancher UI, you should be able to follow the steps in the previous section, but instead use the URL from the output above in the Developer Load dialog.

You'll note that if you reload the Rancher UI, the extension is not persistent and will need to be added again. You can make it persistent by checking the `Persist extension by creating custom resource` checkbox in the Developer Load dialog.

## Wrap-up

This guide has showed you how to create a skeleton application that helps you develop and test one or more extensions.

We showed how we can develop and test those with hot-reload in the browser and how we can build our extensions into a package that we can dynamically load into Rancher at runtime.
