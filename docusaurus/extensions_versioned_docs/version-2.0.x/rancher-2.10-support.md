# Rancher 2.10.0 update

## Advance Notice

The Rancher UI, the Shell and the UI Extensions mechanism is being updated from the Vue 2 framework to the Vue 3 framework.

This is a breaking change that will require existing Rancher UI Extensions to be migrated to Vue 3, built and published.

Our intent is to provide migration documentation to assist UI Extension authors in this migration.

More information will be available as development progresses.
