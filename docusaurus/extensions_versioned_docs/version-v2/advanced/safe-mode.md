# Safe Mode

If you have an extension installed which blocks the loading or navigating of Rancher Dashboard, you can use Safe Mode to disable the misbehaving extensions. To use Safe Mode, there's a query parameter called `safemode` which you can use.

To enable Safe Mode, you must enter your Rancher Dashboard in the following way: 
* `https://<- YOUR RANCHER BASE URL ->/<- ANY PAGE ->?safemode`.
