# Usecases/Examples

In order to help developers with Rancher Extensions we've created this chapter where one can find some concise examples of key Entension integration types. 

We aim to provide full working example of these code examples, which can be deployed as an Extension on you Rancher Dashboard, can be found on the [Rancher examples repo](https://github.com/rancher/ui-plugin-examples). Just follow the instructions described on the [README](https://github.com/rancher/ui-plugin-examples#readme) on how to add the repo to Rancher Dasboard.
