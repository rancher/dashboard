    "description": "This policy is a replacement for the Kubernetes Pod Security Policy that controls the usage of `hostPath` volumes. The policy inspects both the containers and the init containers that are using `hostPath` volumes. `allowedHostPaths` is a list of host paths that are allowed to be used by hostPath volumes. An empty `allowedHostPaths` list means there is no restriction on host paths used. Each entry of `allowedHostPaths` must have: a `pathPrefix` field, which allows hostPath volumes to mount a path that begins with an allowed prefix, and a `readOnly` field indicating it must be mounted read-only.",
