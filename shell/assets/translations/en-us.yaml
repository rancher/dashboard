  typeDescriptions:
    apps.daemonset: DaemonSets run exactly one pod on every eligible node. When new nodes are added to the cluster, DaemonSets automatically deploy to them. Recommended for system-wide or vertically-scalable workloads that never need more than one pod per node.
    apps.deployment: Deployments run a scalable number of replicas of a pod distributed among the eligible nodes. Changes are rolled out incrementally and can be rolled back to the previous revision when needed. Recommended for stateless & horizontally-scalable workloads.
    apps.statefulset: StatefulSets manage stateful applications and provide guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of the pods created. Recommended for workloads with persistent storage or strict identity, quorum, or upgrade order requirements.
    batch.cronjob: CronJobs create Jobs, which then run Pods, on a repeating schedule. The schedule is expressed in standard Unix cron format, and uses the timezone of the Kubernetes control plane (typically UTC).
    batch.job: Jobs create one or more pods to reliably perform a one-time task by running a pod until it exits successfully. Failed pods are automatically replaced until the specified number of completed runs has been reached. Jobs can also run multiple pods in parallel or function as a batch work queue.
    pod: Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes. A Pod is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers.

  jwt.authentication: Enable this feature on a cluster to add support for JWT authenticating downstream service accounts.
  branding: "Branding allows administrators to globally re-brand the UI by customizing the Rancher product name, logos and color scheme."
  chart: "All charts have at least one version that is installable on clusters with Linux and Windows nodes unless otherwise indicated."
  cis.cattle.io.clusterscanbenchmark: A benchmark version is the name of benchmark to run using kube-bench as well as the valid configuration parameters for that benchmark.
  cis.cattle.io.clusterscanprofile: A profile is the configuration for the CIS scan, which is the benchmark versions to use and any specific tests to skip in that benchmark.
  cis.cattle.io.clusterscan: A scan is created to trigger a CIS scan on the cluster based on the defined profile. A report is created after the scan is completed.
  cis.cattle.io.clusterscanreport: A report is the result of a CIS scan of the cluster.
  management.cattle.io.feature: Feature Flags allow certain {vendor} features to be toggled on and off.  Features that are off by default should be considered experimental functionality.
  cluster.x-k8s.io.machine: A Machine encapsulates the configuration of a Kubernetes Node. Use this view to see what happens after updating a cluster.
  cluster.x-k8s.io.machinedeployment: A Machine Deployment orchestrates deployments via templates over a collection of Machine Sets (similar to a Deployment). Use this view to see what happens after updating a cluster.
  cluster.x-k8s.io.machineset: A Machine Set ensures the desired number of Machine resources are up and running at all times (similar to a ReplicaSet). Use this view to see what happens after updating a cluster.
  resources.cattle.io.backup: A backup is created to perform one-time backups or schedule recurring backups based on a ResourceSet.
  resources.cattle.io.restore: A restore is created to trigger a restore to the cluster based on a backup file.
  resources.cattle.io.resourceset: A resource set defines which CRDs and resources to store in the backup.
  monitoring.coreos.com.servicemonitor: A service monitor defines the group of services and the endpoints that Prometheus will scrape for metrics. This is the most common way to define metrics collection.
  monitoring.coreos.com.podmonitor: A pod monitor defines the group of pods that Prometheus will scrape for metrics. The common way is to use service monitors, but pod monitors allow you to handle any situation where a service monitor wouldn't work.
  monitoring.coreos.com.prometheusrule: A Prometheus Rule resource defines both recording and/or alert rules. A recording rule can pre-compute values and save the results. Alerting rules allow you to define conditions on when to send notifications to AlertManager.
  monitoring.coreos.com.prometheus: A Prometheus server is a Prometheus deployment whose scrape configuration and rules are determined by selected ServiceMonitors, PodMonitors, and PrometheusRules and whose alerts will be sent to all selected Alertmanagers with the custom resource's configuration.
  monitoring.coreos.com.alertmanager: An alert manager is deployment whose configuration will be specified by a secret in the same namespace, which determines which alerts should go to which receiver.
  node: The base Kubernetes Node resource represents a virtual or physical machine which hosts deployments. To manage the machine lifecycle, if available, go to Cluster Management.
  catalog.cattle.io.clusterrepo: 'A chart repository is a Helm repository or {vendor} git based application catalog. It provides the list of available charts in the cluster.'
  catalog.cattle.io.clusterrepo.local: ' A chart repository is a Helm repository or {vendor} git based application catalog. It provides the list of available charts in the cluster. Cluster Templates are deployed via Helm charts.'
  catalog.cattle.io.operation: An operation is the list of recent Helm operations that have been applied to the cluster.
  catalog.cattle.io.app: An installed application is a Helm 3 chart that was installed either via our charts or through the Helm CLI.
  logging.banzaicloud.io.clusterflow: Logs from the cluster will be collected and logged to the selected Cluster Output.
  logging.banzaicloud.io.clusteroutput: A cluster output defines which logging providers that logs can be sent to and is only effective when deployed in the namespace that the logging operator is in.
  logging.banzaicloud.io.flow: A flow defines which logs to collect and filter as well as which output to send the logs. The flow is a namespaced resource, which means logs will only be collected from the namespace that the flow is deployed in.
  logging.banzaicloud.io.output: An output defines which logging providers that logs can be sent to. The output needs to be in the same namespace as the flow that is using it.
  group.principal: Assigning global roles to a group only works with external auth providers that support groups. Local authorization does not support groups.
