Danger banners should be used when the system has failed to perform an action, or when the user has made an error. * Never include a "close" icon or link to dismiss the action.

They are display in the section of the application related to the information.

  <Story
    name="Error"
    args={{
      label:    'The connection has been lost. Check your connection and refresh this page.',
      closable: false,
      color:    'error',
    }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>

### Accessibility
Make sure that the information presented in an alert is important enough to justify taking away the userâ€™s attention from what they are doing (ie. errors, warnings, validations, etc.).

### General
- Use the role='alert' attribute when defining the alert. It should only be used when the user needs immediate attention due to its intrusive nature.
- The WAI-ARIA role='alert' is equivalent to aria-live='assertive'. Screen readers are notified immediately of the error so the user can take action to address the issue.
- When an alert is present in the screen on load time (i.e. the alert isn't a response to a user's action), it should use the aria-live='polite' attribute to avoid disrupting the order in which the elements are presented on the screen. This does not apply to danger alerts though, since critical alerts should always come first.
- The close button contains the aria-label='close' attibute and the icon uses aria-hidden='true' so it is ignored by assistive technologies. The danger alert does not include a button since it's not dismissable.

### Considerations
- Ensure that the close button is included in the tabbing order and the alert can be navigated to and dismissed with the keyboard. The
- Make sure colour and icons aren't the only way information is conveyed.
