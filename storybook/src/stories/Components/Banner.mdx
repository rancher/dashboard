### Accessibility

Make sure that the information presented in an alert is important enough to justify taking away the userâ€™s attention from what they are doing (ie. errors, warnings, validations, etc.).

### General

- Use the role='alert' attribute when defining the alert. It should only be used when the user needs immediate attention due to its intrusive nature.
- The WAI-ARIA role='alert' is equivalent to aria-live='assertive'. Screen readers are notified immediately of the error so the user can take action to address the issue.
- When an alert is present in the screen on load time (i.e. the alert isn't a response to a user's action), it should use the aria-live='polite' attribute to avoid disrupting the order in which the elements are presented on the screen. This does not apply to danger alerts though, since critical alerts should always come first.
- The close button contains the aria-label='close' attibute and the icon uses aria-hidden='true' so it is ignored by assistive technologies. The danger alert does not include a button since it's not dismissable.

### Considerations

- Ensure that the close button is included in the tabbing order and the alert can be navigated to and dismissed with the keyboard. The
- Make sure colour and icons aren't the only way information is conveyed.
