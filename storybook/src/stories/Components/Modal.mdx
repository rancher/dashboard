# Modal 

The <code>AppModal</code> component is a reusable Vue modal component that provides a simple way to display content in a modal overlay.

### Description

<strong>Note:</strong> AppModal renders modal content outside of the control of Vue, via <code>&lt;div id="modals" /&gt;</code> located within <code>index.html</code>. This allows Dashboard to position the modal as the very last node in the page's <code>body</code>, making styling and positioning much easier and less error-prone.
