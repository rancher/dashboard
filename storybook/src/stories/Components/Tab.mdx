# Tab

Tabs are used to separate information into logical sections and to quickly navigate between them.

### Description
- Use tabs when there is a large amount of content that can be separated.
- Use tabs to make the content accessible without reloading the page or compromising on space.
- Write short tab labels. Try not to use more than two words for a tab label.

- Secondary tabs never appear without a parent set of primary tabs.
- The number of secondary tabs inside vertical tabs should be as small as possible â€“ not more than six are recommended.

#### Horizontal Tabs
- Horizontal tabs are best used with ten or fewer tabs. This maintains an uncluttered UI and reduces cognitive load for users.
- Write short tab labels. Especially with a large number of tabs and little horizontal screen space.
- Stick to only one row of tabs. Use tab navigation when the content categories fit in a single row.

#### Side/Vertical Tabs
