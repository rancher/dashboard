# Select

The select element represents a control that allows the user to choose from a number of options. The single selection element is represented visually by a dropdown.

### Description

- Always associate a label to every select element for good accessibility. Do not include a colon at the end of the label.
- Dropdown select lists allow users to select one item at a time, multiple select boxes (aka list boxes) allow users to select multiple items at a time.
